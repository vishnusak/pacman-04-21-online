##Updates - 26-April:
- Added heat-seeking to the ghost. I think the ghost's "Pacman Seeking" ability is pretty good. Not the best by a long way, but definitely servicable.

##Updates - 24-April:
- Slightly modified the grid
- Introduced ghost
  - moves independant of pacman
  - doesn't go through walls
  - kills pacman if they meet
- game over message displayed
- ToDo improvement: make ghost target pacman. Right now it just moves randomly, so its not much of a threat

##FEATURE WISH LIST

1. Collision detection (PacMan shouldn't walk through walls!) - DONE
2. More complex maze!                                         - DONE (24 x 33 grid)
3. Scoreboard!                                                - DONE
4. Reorient PacMan according to direction of movement         - DONE

###HACKER FEATURE:
5. Add ghosts that move independently w/ collision detection  - Partially DONE
